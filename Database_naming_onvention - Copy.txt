Database naming conventions:
1.Database names must only consist of the letters a to z (both lower and upper case allowed), the numbers 0 to 9, and the underscore (_) or dash (-) symbols This also means that any non-ASCII database names are not allowed
2.Database names must always start with a letter. Database names starting with an underscore are considered to be system databases, and users should not create or delete those
3.The maximum allowed length of a database name is 64 bytes
4.Database names are case-sensitive
Table naming conventions:
1.Plural form
2.camel case
Table name is case sensitive or not:
Answer is No,
Table names are stored in lowercase on disk and name comparisons are not case-sensitive. MySQL converts all table names to lowercase on storage and lookup. This behavior also applies to database names and table aliases.
Column naming convention:
1.all letters should be in lower case
2.multiple words can be joined by using unser scores
1. Make all declarative keywords their own new line if possible because it’s easier to read and understand which table and which columns are being referenced:
example,
SELECT * FROM tablex
 WHERE variabley=z 
 AND variablea=12
 AND variableb=15 
legible than 
 select * from tablex where variabley=z AND variablea=12 AND variableb=15
2. Make all declarative statements and DB functions uppercase
example,
SELECT * FROM tablex
WHERE variabley=z 
AND variablea=12
AND variableb=15
ORDER BY RAND()
LIMIT 1
is legible than 
 select * from tablex
 where variabley=z 
 AND variablea=12
 AND variableb=15
 order by RAND()
 limit 1
3.Try to minimize the sub query
4.Include comments

(i) single line
--this is sinle line comment
/*multi 
line 
comment*/
